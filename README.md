The [Lighthouse Free Medical Clinic](https://www.lighthousefreemedicalclinic.com/clinic) is a student-run medical clinic dedicated to providing free healthcare to uninsured and underserved patients in Buffalo, New York. Many, if not all, of these patients require specialists for their treatment. However, in order for a patient to see a specialist, they must:

1. Have insurance
2. Reach a primary care physician (PCP) who accepts their insurance
3. Have the PCP refer them to a specialist

Many patients at Lighthouse do not have insurance and typically require Medicaid/Medicare. While enrolling in Medicaid/Medicare, many patients lack a clear understanding of the various health insurance plans available to them. Furthermore, patients often struggle to access PCPs due to transportation issues and long wait times.

# Solution
Introducing _Insurance Radar_, a simple web application designed to help patients understand their health plan options while guiding them to outpatient clinics that accept Medicaid.

Under the _Affordable Care Act_, a website was created to help patients find the best possible health insurance plans under Medicaid. Insurance Radar scrapes health insurance plan information from the [New York Health Insurance Marketplace](https://nystateofhealth.ny.gov/) and recommends health plans that are widely accepted across Erie County and suit patients' needs. This allows patients to find the best health insurance options for living in Erie County. Insurance Radar also provides a list of PCPs that accept Medicare. The first step in getting a patient to a specialist is finding them a PCP. Insurance Radar can streamline this process!
